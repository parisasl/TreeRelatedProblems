Solutions of tree-related problems implemented in Python

- Max Depth Problem

Given the structure of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] 
Output: 3

- Path Sum Problem:

Given the structure of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true

- Symmetric Tree Problem:

Given the structure of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
